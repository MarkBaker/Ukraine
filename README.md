Support Ukraine
==========

A PHP Composer Plug-in to show support for Ukraine

---

## Installation

Include this plug-in in the `composer.json` file for your own libraries:

```
    "require": {
        ...,
        "markbaker/ukraine": "*"
    },
```

For Composer v2, you may also need to include a reference in the `allow-plugins` section of your `composer.json`. 

```
    "config": {
        "sort-packages": true,
        "allow-plugins": {
            "markbaker/ukraine": true
        }
    },
```
